### It starts with:
-    One thing, I don't know why
-    It doesn't even matter how hard you try
-    Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
-    To explain in due time all I know
-    Time is a valuable thing
-    Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
-    Watch it count down to the end of the day
-    The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal


I have no regrets.
