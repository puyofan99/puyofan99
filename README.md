### It starts with:
- 🌱 One thing, I don't know why
- 👯 It doesn't even matter how hard you try
- 🤔 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
- 💬 To explain in due time all I know
- 📫 Time is a valuable thing
- 😄 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
- ⚡ Watch it count down to the end of the day
-    The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
